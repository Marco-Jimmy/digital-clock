# Digital Clock
Website:
https://marco-jimmy.github.io/digital-clock/

This is a simple & naive front-end project. The goal of this project is for me to learn how front end works and how to set up a website.

Obviously, the function of this website is limited to display time. Hence, I plan to add some interactive elements to make it somewhat dynamic.

Task List:
- [ ] Different timezones to choose
- [ ] User-friendly for phone user
